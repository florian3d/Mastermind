You can undo wrong color by double clicking on it (before you set a group of 4).

Everytime you setup group of 4 colors you'll get a hint. Black means you guess a colour and it's at propper plase. White means you guess color but it's not at propper place. Darker gray - color don't exists. Color positions in hint is not representation of colors in guess group, black are always drawn firsrt.<br>
Have fun!
